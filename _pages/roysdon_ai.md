# Overview

The Roysdon AI & Cyber Toolbox brings together applied mathematics, modern machine learning, and cyber-network analysis into a cohesive engineering toolkit.  This toolbox reflects both peer-reviewed research and operational analytics work. (*)

# Toolboxes

## Simulation & Analysis
- [**TabMT**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Papers/NeurIPS_2023_TabMT.pdf) Generating Tabular data with Masked Transformers. **This work should be credited to my brilliant co-author, Manbir Gulati, who presented at NeurIPS 2023 and earned the Leidos CTO Award.**
- [**ilpLite**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/ilp_lite) is a complete implementation of integer linear programming for network analysis.
- [**JPDAF**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/jpdaf) is a complete implementation of a joint-probability data-association filter (JPDAF); basically a cascaded EKF for object tracking.
- [**Network Flow**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/network_flow) performs a network flow anaysis using ilpLite.
- [**OFDM**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/applied_math/ofdm) is an advanced sim for othogonal frequency division multiplexing.
