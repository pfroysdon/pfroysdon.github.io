I focus on clear declaration of variables and documentation of equations/algorithms, e.g., full derivations and proofs, not found elsewhere in the literature.

</p>

The [Technical Notes](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Tech_Notes) folder contains a collection of *Technical Notes* on various subjects, e.g., AI, Navigation, Math, Machine Learning, etc.  

The [Complete Math Derivations and Proofs](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Math_Derivations) folder contains a collection of *Math Derivations and Proofs* on various subjects in AI and Machine Learning.

The [Math References](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Math_References) folder is a collection of *Math References* on various subjects in Mathematics, e.g., the *Linear Algebra* document has a list of commonly used equations that most folks learned in college (and likely forgot), with a section that lists common mistakes (so that you don't repeat them)..

The [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Cheatsheet) and [Flow-Chart](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/blob/main/Flow_Chart) folders have great machine learning tools to help you decide the right algorithm for your data.

The [Technical Papers](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Papers) folder contains most of the journal papers, conference papers, and technical notes that I have published.  Topics include: AI and machine learning, aircraft design, autopilot design, GPS-INS ("SatNav"), navigation system design, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), applied mathematics and probability theory.
