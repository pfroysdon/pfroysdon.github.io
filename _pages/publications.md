I focus on clear declaration of variables and documentation of equations/algorithms, e.g., full derivations and proofs, not found elsewhere in the literature.

[This folder](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Tech_Notes) is a collection of technical reference notes on various subjects, e.g., Navigation, Math, Machine Learning, etc.
For example *Algebra* has a list of commonly used algebra equations that most folks learned in high school (and likely forgot), with a section of common algebra mistakes (so that you don't repeat the mistakes).

# Technical Papers	
<p align="center">

[This folder](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Papers) contains most of the journal papers, conference papers, and technical notes that I have published.  The topics range from computational fluid dynamics (CFD), aircraft design, autopilot design, GPS-INS ("SatNav") and navigation system design, applied mathematics and probability theory.
