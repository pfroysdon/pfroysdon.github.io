*"In everything, commit yourself to excellence and integrity." - P. F. Roysdon*

Dr. Paul Roysdon is an AI, quantum computing, and cybersecurity innovator who has spent his career at the forefront of cutting-edge research and mission-critical technology development. He has served as **Deputy Director of National Intelligence**, **Chief Data Scientist at NSA**, and **Chief AI Scientist & Vice President at Leidos**, where he led both elite research teams and organizations of 1,000+ engineers and analysts solving some of the world’s hardest technical problems. His work spans AI/ML, adversarial learning, cryptanalysis, autonomous systems, offensive and defensive cyber, and quantum-informed computing for national security and advanced commercial applications.

Dr. Roysdon is a patented inventor with 2 issued and 4 pending patents in AI and cyber operations, the author of **6 peer-reviewed** [**textbooks**](http://www.roysdonfibonaccipress.com/), and the creator of numerous [scientific papers](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Papers) and [technical notes](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Tech_Notes). His 2022 NeurIPS Spotlight paper “TabMT” advanced multi-task tabular learning and earned the Leidos CTO Award for AI Innovation. He earned multiple awards: **NSA Inventor Award**, **NSA Director’s Reserve Award**, **ODNI Director’s Award**, **Leidos Innovation in R&D Award** and **2× Leidos CTO Awards**. He is passionate about bridging research and real-world impact, accelerating next-generation AI and quantum solutions from prototype to operational deployment.

Outside of his [personal research](https://pfroysdon.github.io/projects/), he is a competition [aerobatics pilot](https://youtu.be/AFlVtWswTNU) in his Pitts S2 and a horologist, designing and crafting [precision mechanical timepieces](https://www.roysdonwatchco.com/), reflecting his lifelong fascination with engineering, physics, and the art of precision systems.
