*"In everything, commit yourself to excellence and integrity." - P. F. Roysdon*

Dr. Paul Roysdon is an AI, quantum computing, and cybersecurity innovator who has spent his career at the forefront of cutting-edge research and mission-critical technology development. He has served as **Deputy Director of National Intelligence at ODNI**, **Chief Data Scientist at NSA**, and **Chief AI Scientist & Vice President at Leidos**, where he led both elite research teams and organizations of 1,000+ engineers and analysts solving some of the world’s hardest technical problems. His work spans AI/ML, adversarial learning, cryptanalysis, autonomous systems, offensive and defensive cyber, and quantum-informed computing for national security and advanced commercial applications.

Dr. Roysdon is a patented inventor with 2 issued and 4 pending patents in AI and cyber, the author of **5 peer-reviewed** [**AI textbooks**](http://www.roysdonfibonaccipress.com/), and the creator of numerous [scientific papers](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Papers) and [technical notes](https://github.com/pfroysdon/publications/tree/main/Tech_Notes). He earned multiple awards: **NSA Inventor Award**, **NSA Director’s Reserve Award**, **ODNI Director’s Award**, **Leidos Innovation in R&D Award** and **2× Leidos CTO Awards**. His **2023 NeurIPS Spotlight paper** “TabMT: Generating Tabular data with Masked Transformers” earned the **Leidos CTO Award for AI Innovation**.  He is passionate about bridging research and real-world impact, accelerating next-generation AI solutions from prototype to operational deployment.

Dr. Roysdon’s academic journey, undertaken while working full-time, is a testament to his unwavering dedication and deep passion for many fields. He holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, with a dual focus on applied mathematics and probability theory. His educational achievements also include an M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering, an M.S. in Electrical Engineering, an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and a B.S. in both Aeronautical and Mechanical Engineering. He also completed graduate studies in Theoretical Physics and Constitutional Law with a focus AI.

Outside of his [personal research](https://pfroysdon.github.io/projects/), he is a competition [aerobatics pilot](https://youtu.be/AFlVtWswTNU) in his Pitts S2 and a horologist, designing and crafting [precision mechanical timepieces](https://www.roysdonwatchco.com/), reflecting his lifelong fascination with engineering, physics, and the art of precision systems.
