This is a collection of projects that result fomr decades of engineering experience, personal research, and academic publications.  

Note: **Most projects require a password to access the source code**, while others are free and open to the public.  This page is a **work in progress,** some projects are better documented than others.  I will clean this up as I have time to do so.

# Roysdon AI & Cyber Toolbox
The [**Roysdon AI & Cyber Toolbox**](https://pfroysdon.github.io/projects/roysdon_ai/) brings together applied mathematics, modern machine learning, and cyber-network analysis into a cohesive engineering toolkit.  This toolbox reflects both peer-reviewed research and operational analytics work.

# Roysdon Aero Toolbox
The [**Roysdon Aero Toolbox**](https://pfroysdon.github.io/projects/roysdon_aero/) is an industry-grade full-stack aircraft and missile engineering environment, spanning conceptual design, high-fidelity simulation, flight controls, and embedded real-time software.  The tools in this toolbox were used to develop, flight test and deploy multiple Military aircraft.

# Roysdon Nav Toolbox
The [**Roysdon Nav Toolbox**](https://pfroysdon.github.io/projects/roysdon_nav/) is an industry-grade state-of-the-art navigation engineering environment, built around optimal estimation theory and real-world sensor behavior.  The tools in this toolbox were used to develop, flight test and deploy multiple Military aircraft.

# Roysdon Musings
This repo is a collection of random projects:
- [**Garden Bot**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/musings/garden_bot) is a real-time embedded software for a garden irrigation system.
- [**Package Shaker**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/musings/package_shaker) is a real-time embedded software for a "Gag Gift" that, when triggered, either shakes a package, sounds a siren or plays a melody.
- [**Greenhouse**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/musings/greenhouse) is a complete build guide with blueprints for 10'x12' floating panel greenhouse that can be built using common tools and materials sourced from any home-improvement store.

# Roysdon Watch Co
This repo is a collection of tools for **watchmakers**:
- [**Beat Rate**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/watchmaker/beat_rate) this tool uses recorded audio of a mechanical watch to determine the beat rate and phase of the balance.  Beat error results in a watch running fast or slow.  This enables the precise adjustment of a mechanical watch to reduce beat error. 
- [**Guilloche CAD/CAM**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/watchmaker/guilloche) this toolbox generates complex geometric patterns for wrist watch dials, and then generates the tool paths and g-code (machine code) for use on a CNC mill.
- [**Hairspring Calculations**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/blob/main/watchmaker/hairspring) This project contains a complete report of the equations, derivations and unit conversion to calculate the length of a hairspring for any material, thickness, and height.  A spreadsheet "calculator" is also provided, to automatically calculate the length given a few input parameters.
- [**Laser Settings**](https://github.com/pfroysdon/projects/tree/main/watchmaker/laser_testing) this repository contains laser test files and examples for a JPT 50W fiber laser.
