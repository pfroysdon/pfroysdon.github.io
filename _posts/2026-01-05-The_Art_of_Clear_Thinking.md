**200 MPH. 2,000 feet off the deck. No room for hesitation.**

### Why I’m Starting the Year Upside‑Down  

A few weeks ago I was flying an aerobatic Pitts at **200 mph**, inverted, just **2,000 ft** above the ground. A sudden mechanical failure caused me to lose most of my fuel while I was under negative G. The canopy filled with fuel, the horizon vanished, and I had **under one second** to answer three questions:

1. **Where am I?** – Re‑orient the aircraft before I lost spatial awareness.  
2. **Can I stay airborne?** – Is the remaining fuel enough for a recovery?  
3. **What’s my exit?** – Do I attempt a forced landing or eject the canopy and parachute to safety?

The answer to each was binary, and the cost of delay was catastrophic: at 200 mph I would hit the ground in a few seconds.

That split‑second decision loop is exactly what most leadership advice gets wrong. It isn’t about being the loudest voice in the room or having the strongest personality. It’s about a **repeatable process** that lets you think clearly when time compresses and uncertainty spikes.

### The Four‑Step Mental Model That Saved My Life – And Can Save Your Business  

| Step | What It Looks Like in the Cockpit | Executive Translation |
|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **1️⃣ Stabilize Attention** | Shut out the roar of the engine, focus on a single reference point (the horizon). | Block the noise. Identify one concrete fact you know for sure and anchor your mind to it. |
| **2️⃣ Separate Signal from Noise** | Filter out the fuel‑filled canopy; the only reliable data is airspeed and altitude indicator. | Distinguish what truly matters right now (e.g., a board member’s “show‑me‑the‑numbers” demand) from peripheral chatter. |
| **3️⃣ Choose a Path & Commit** | Pick a heading, pull the throttle, set the recovery maneuver—no second‑guessing. | Decide on a clear course of action (accept a partnership, push back on a request, issue a statement) and own it. |
| **4️⃣ Execute Cleanly & Calmly** | Apply smooth control inputs; fly the plane! | Communicate concisely, delegate precisely, and avoid “analysis paralysis” after the decision is made. |

The beauty of this framework is that **the aircraft changes, but the pressure pattern stays the same**: incomplete information, high consequence, and a clock that doesn’t care how smart you are.

Save this four‑step model.  Print it, laminate it, stick it on your monitor. When the next high‑pressure moment hits, you’ll have a ready‑made process instead of scrambling for a “gut feeling.”  Use it also as a debrief after your next big decision.

### From Aerobatics to the Boardroom  

Boardrooms aren’t life‑or‑death arenas, but they *are* moments where “I’ll get back to you” is not an option. A surprise question from a director, a sudden regulatory inquiry, or a hostile technical challenge can demand the same rapid framing and execution.

My years of flight testing and aerobatics training gave me a disciplined mental model for those situations:

- **Rapid situation framing** under uncertainty  
- **Prioritization of first‑order vs. second‑order effects** (what will happen now vs. what will cascade later)  
- **Calm execution** without cognitive overload  
- **Precise communication** when stakes are high  

These habits let me make technical trade‑offs, respond publicly, defend decisions under scrutiny, and lead teams through inflection points with the same composure required at 200 mph upside down.

### Your Turn: Seconds vs. Days  

> **When was the last time you had to decide in seconds—not days?**  

If you can’t recall a recent example, it’s probably because you haven’t built the habit of rapid, structured thinking yet. Start training today:

1. **Pick a low‑stakes scenario** (e.g., an unexpected email from a teammate).  
2. **Apply the 4‑step model** in under 30 seconds.  
3. **Debrief:** Did you stabilize attention? Did you over‑correct?

Repeat, and soon the process will be second nature—even when the stakes are sky‑high.

### TL;DR (for busy execs)

- **Pressure isn’t about personality—it’s about process.**  
- **Four steps:** Stabilize → Filter → Choose & Commit → Execute Cleanly & Calmly.  
- **Transferable:** Same mental model that kept me alive at 200 mph inverted works for boardrooms, crisis communications, and rapid product pivots.  
- **Actionable:** Download the steps as a cheat sheet and practice the framework on everyday surprises.
