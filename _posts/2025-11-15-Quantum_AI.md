**Quantum AI Isn’t “Coming Someday.” It’s Becoming an Engineering Deadline.**

Most people still think quantum computing is a science project. That framing is already obsolete.

In my latest paper, I lay out what the field is converging on: the million-qubit threshold — the scale where fault-tolerant systems can unlock hundreds to thousands of logical qubits and move from prototypes to consequential capability. 

The real story isn't hype. It's the engineering stack: control electronics that can program millions of qubits, error correction that actually suppresses error rates, and facility-scale realities like cryogenics, wiring, and power. A system of this scale may draw data-center-class power (on the order of ~10–20 MW, depending on architecture) — because "the computer" is the quantum hardware plus the classical control plane that makes it run. And the timeline pressure is real. Recent resource estimates suggest RSA-2048 could be within reach with ~1 million noisy qubits running for about a week, given algorithm and error-correction advances. This paper is a roadmap—hardware platforms, software, error correction, and systems engineering — written for leaders who need to plan for quantum as national infrastructure, not a curiosity.

Final Thoughts: 
- If quantum becomes infrastructure, who in your organization owns the plan—security, IT, R&D, or the CEO?  
- If you had to defend your organization against "harvest now, decrypt later," what data would you protect differently starting this quarter?
