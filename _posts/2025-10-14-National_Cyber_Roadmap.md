**Cyber risk is now a persistent strategic threat—impacting national security, public safety, and economic stability.**

What's changing isn't just the threat landscape. It's the national response: the U.S. is moving away from voluntary, outcome-light security postures and toward outcome-based regulation, software liability pressure, and architectures that remove entire classes of failure (zero trust, memory-safe software, and post-quantum cryptography). 

My new paper proposes a 2025–2035 Cybersecurity Roadmap that integrates what most strategies separate: policy, engineering, partnerships, and acquisitions—tied to measurable milestones. 

The core build plan is straightforward:

- Harden and harmonize (2025–2026): phishing-resistant MFA, SSDF/SBOM, early PQC deployment, incident reporting alignment. 

- Operate and automate (2027–2029): unified telemetry + automated containment, threat-informed defense, cross-sector exercises, PQC at scale. 

- Resilience and recovery (2030–2035): self-healing architectures, regulatory convergence, and full PQC migration for high-value assets. 

This isn't about "more tools." It's about engineering outcomes—reduced blast radius, faster containment, faster recovery, and a posture that can keep up with real adversaries.
