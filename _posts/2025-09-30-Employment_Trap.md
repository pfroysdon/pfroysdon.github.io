**Thoughts while flying vertical!**

I was recently practicing for an upcoming aerobatic competition. I was in the vertical and a thought crossed my mind...

**Traps. Specifically: employment traps.**

OK, I’ll let you in on a little secret.

The biggest risk in any executive job (or any level position) move isn’t the compensation.
It’s not the title.
It’s not even the scope.

It’s the **team you’re walking into**.

The politics.
The support you’ll get when the heat's on.
And the battles no one warns you about.

Because at the executive level, you don't "execute a strategy."
You execute a strategy through people who have their own priorities.

And yet, too many seasoned candidates ask questions like:
- "What's the 90-day plan?"
- "What's the company vision?"
- "What's the culture like?"

Nice.
Polite.
Useless.

Those questions produce rehearsed answers.

What you need is *signal*.

You need to know:
- **Who actually has power** (and who thinks they do).
- **What gets rewarded** (and what gets punished).
- **How conflict is handled** (directly, politically, or not at all).
- **Whether leadership protects outcomes**... or protects egos.
- **Whether you’ll be backed in public** — or sacrificed for optics.

Because "culture" isn't posters and perks.
Culture is what happens when:

- the numbers miss,

- a launch slips,

- a security issue hits,

- a customer escalates,

- or the board wants a head.

That's when you find out what the place really is.

And this is why the line matters:

**Culture eats strategy for breakfast.**

Strategy is what you *say* you'll do.
Culture is what your organization will *allow* you to do.

So before you say yes, don't just negotiate comp.
**Audit the operating system you’re about to inherit.**

End question:
&rarr; *When was the last time you chose a role based on the team you were walking into — not the title you were walking toward?*
