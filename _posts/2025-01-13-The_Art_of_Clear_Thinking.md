Today I thought that I would start the year with a post about something that happened to me whlie flying aerobatics, 200 MPH, and just 2000 ft off the deck.  I was reminded that clear thinking in an emergency, when every milli-second matters, is transferabled to executive leadership.  [Here](https://pfroysdon.github.io/files/Roysdon_1page_The_Art_of_Clear_Thinking.pdf) is the paper.
