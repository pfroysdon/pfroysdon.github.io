AI is no longer a “software story.” It’s a national infrastructure story.

Most people talk about AI in terms of demos—chatbots, copilots, and clever automations. Leaders can’t afford to think that way. Real advantage comes from what’s underneath: compute, energy, data pipelines, security, governance, and the ability to deploy at scale.

In my latest paper, "AI for National Security," I make a straightforward case: if the U.S. wants durable economic and strategic advantage, we have to treat AI like critical infrastructure—not a collection of pilots, not a procurement line-item, and not something we outsource by default.

The core issue isn’t imagination. It’s execution. Frontier AI increasingly concentrates in a handful of organizations with the capital, compute, and talent to build at scale—while public-sector missions face slower acquisition, fragmented data, and uneven access to serious infrastructure.

This paper lays out a practical blueprint: national-scale compute access, modern data architecture, secure deployment patterns, and acquisition models that match the speed of threats. It’s a build plan—focused on capability, accountability, and time-to-field.

Final thought:<br>
If you lead in government, defense, critical infrastructure, or enterprise AI, this is the framework for moving from "AI interest" to **AI power**.
